Welcome to CodeGarden, the Fertile Ground for Code! Our website makes it easy for programmers to share their code with others. There are multiple things you can do on CodeGarden:

1. Search. On the homepage you will find a Searchbar. You can use it to Search code from other users across CodeGarden. 

2. Upload. Programmers can upload their code on our website. On the homepage, you can see a button labeled "upload". When you press this button, you will go to "upload.php". On this page, you can put your own code and when you press "Upload Code" the code will be stored in our database.

3. Share. After the code is stored in the database, you will be given the option to share your code with others. There is a button labeled "Share". After pressing it, you will be directed to a page called "share.php". There, a generated link will be given to you. You can share this link with others by pressing the "copy" button and pasting it anywhere you like.

4. Browse your own and others code. On this page, you will find either your own projects or projects from other users who have made their project public for other users. If you press the "open" button, you will be directed to a new page where you can read, edit and share the code.
