Welcome to CodeGarden, the Fertile Ground for Code! Our website makes it easy for programmers to share their code with others.


--How do you use CodeGarden?--

The first page you need to open is index.php. If you are not logged in you will be redirected to login.php. Here you can login or create an account. When you have logged in. you will be on the homepage of CodeGarden. Here you can Search, Upload ahd share code. Below, you can see what all of the buttons do:

1. Search. On the homepage you will find a Searchbar. You can use it to Search code from other users across CodeGarden. 

2. Upload. Programmers can upload their code on our website. On the homepage, you can see a button labeled "upload". When you press this button, you will go to "upload.php". On this page, you can put your own code and when you press "Upload Code" the code will be stored in our database.

3. Share. After the code is stored in the database, you will be given the option to share your code with others. There is a button labeled "Share". After pressing it, you will be directed to a page called "share.php". There, a generated link will be given to you. You can share this link with others by pressing the "copy" button and pasting it anywhere you like.

4. Browse your own and others code. On this page, you will find either your own projects or projects from other users who have made their project public for other users. If you press the "open" button, you will be directed to a new page where you can read, edit and share the code. 




--Thing we wanted to include but haven't gotten the time for--

1. The searchbar: We wanted to make it more elaborate, but we didn't have the time for it. We also wanted to add filters so you can search for code language like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL.

2. The linkgenerator. We don't own the codegarden domain name. So couldn't add a working link for the projects.

3. The upload page. We wanted to make the upload.php file mobile first. We tried to do this, but this was harder than we thought. 

4. We wanted to make the redirect.php page look more like the rest of the website. But we didn't have time left to do this.



--Bugs on our page--

1. If you upload only one code to either public or private projects, it will result in a box looking stretched. However, if you upload more than 1 code the page will look normal.

2. on the mobile version of the contactpage the email adress takes up the whole screen. However, the page will look fine on desktops.

3. On some buttons you have to click on the text instead of the whole button.

4. On the search page. You instantly see the results. 

5. The upload.php page is not mobile friendly, but look fine on desktops.
